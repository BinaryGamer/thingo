      <h1>Stephen Hawking (1942 - 2018)</h1>
      <p>
        Stephen Hawking was an English theoretical physicist and cosmologist.
        He is best known for his study of black holes and the discovery that they can emit radiation particles, often called <em>Hawking radiation</em>, even though their immense gravitational attraction means that no matter or energy can escape from inside them.

      <h2>Life</h2>
      <p>
        Stephen Hawking was born on 8 January 1942 in Oxford, England.
        He studied science at Oxford University, and then at Cambridge.

        While Hawking was studying he was diagnosed with ALS, and told that he had just two years to live.
        However, the disease progressed more slowly than the doctors predicted. Hawking went on to have a successful career in science, making major contributions to our understanding of the origins of the universe and the nature of black holes.

        Hawking also got married and had three children.
        He became a famous figure, published a bestselling book called <em>A Brief History of Time</em>, and even appeared on <em>The Simpsons</em> and <em>Star Trek</em>.
        Hawking died on 4 March 2018, at the age of 76. <span class="hidden">0x6d 0x63 0x69 0x66 0x20 0x68 0x6f 0x67 0x79 0x20 0x77 0x67 0x20 0x68 0x63 0x20 0x76 0x6f 0x71 0x79 0x20 0x6f 0x62 0x20 0x77 0x62 0x67 0x68 0x6f 0x75 0x66 0x6f 0x61 0x20 0x6f 0x71 0x71 0x63 0x69 0x62 0x68 0x2c 0x20 0x77 0x68 0x27 0x67 0x20 0x69 0x67 0x73 0x62 0x6f 0x61 0x73 0x20 0x77 0x67 0x20 0x74 0x7a 0x69 0x74 0x74 0x6d 0x71 0x76 0x73 0x67 0x67 0x73 0x64 0x6f 0x62 0x71 0x6f 0x79 0x73 0x67 0x20 0x68 0x76 0x77 0x67 0x20 0x64 0x66 0x63 0x78 0x73 0x71 0x68 0x20 0x6b 0x6f 0x67 0x20 0x71 0x63 0x72 0x73 0x72 0x20 0x6f 0x62 0x72 0x20 0x61 0x6f 0x72 0x73 0x20 0x64 0x63 0x67 0x67 0x77 0x70 0x7a 0x73 0x2c 0x20 0x70 0x6d 0x20 0x7a 0x77 0x6f 0x61 0x20 0x67 0x61 0x77 0x68 0x76 0x20 0x6f 0x62 0x72 0x20 0x72 0x77 0x7a 0x7a 0x77 0x63 0x62 0x20 0x72 0x73 0x67 0x77 0x7a 0x6a 0x6f 0x2e</span>

      <h2>What is ALS?</h2>
      <p>
        ALS stands for <em>amyotrophic lateral sclerosis</em>.
        It is also known as motor neurone disease, or MND.
        ALS is a degenerative disease that paralyses the muscles over time.

      <p>
        As his disease progressed, Hawking lost the ability to walk and talk.
        He started using a wheelchair to move and a computer to communicate by moving muscles in his cheek.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, even though ALS paralysed Hawking's body, his mind remained sharp.
        He continued his work as a physicist, author, and science communicator until his death in 2018.
